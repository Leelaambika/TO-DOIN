# TO-DOIN
Created a to-do for myself, since I don't find anything fancy enough for me! '>'
In our project, we developed a dynamic and responsive To-Do List application integrated with a calendar feature, utilizing HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The primary goal was to create an intuitive interface that allows users to manage tasks efficiently while providing a visual representation of their schedule.

HTML5 Implementation

We structured the application using semantic HTML5 elements to enhance accessibility and maintainability. The layout includes sections for the task input form, filter buttons, task list, and the calendar. Each task entry is encapsulated within list items, enabling easy manipulation and styling.

CSS3 Styling

CSS3 was employed to design a clean and user-friendly interface. We utilized CSS variables to maintain a consistent color scheme and facilitate dark mode toggling. Flexbox and Grid layouts ensured responsiveness across various devices. Interactive elements, such as buttons and input fields, were styled with hover effects and transitions to enhance user experience. The calendar was designed to resemble sticky notes, providing a visually appealing method to display tasks on specific dates.

JavaScript Functionality

JavaScript added interactivity and dynamic behavior to the application. Event listeners handle user actions like adding, editing, and deleting tasks. We implemented local storage to preserve tasks between sessions. The calendar feature was developed to display the current month, navigate between months, and highlight dates with associated tasks. Clicking on a date reveals the tasks scheduled for that day, allowing users to manage their schedule seamlessly.

Conclusion

By integrating HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, we created a functional and aesthetically pleasing To-Do List application with calendar capabilities. This project not only demonstrates our proficiency in front-end development but also provides a practical tool for task management.
